# jQuery_Mobile_Weather_App
Mobile Weather App using jQuery/AJAX


A simple web app using jQuery mobile's framework to display weather conditions in certain locations. Locations can
be easily modified by finding the lat/long coordinates using geocoder.us and modifying the cities object and the text
within the list element. 

Also please utilize your own API key from Forecast.io seeing as there are only 1000 free pulls from their service a day.
